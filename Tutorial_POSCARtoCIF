EBSD data requires that the CIF files contain the crystal symmetry information, which is often lost in various POSCAR2CIF codes, as POSCARs do not contain symmetry data. 

## To convert POSCAR to CIF 
Based on experience, the tool below converts POSCAR to CIF while searching for the highest symmetry structure:

copy paste the POSCAR into the website.


## To find the rotation matrix

If it is a simple axis rotation, you can use CHATGPT to find the rotation matrix
Use OVITO and use Affine Transformation to check that this is correct. 
However, OVITO cannot output CIF files. 
So use VESTA, input the rotation matrix, and export as CIF file.

The CIF file now contains the rotated structure and all its symmetry information is preserved!
